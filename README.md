[Markdown documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)<br/>

## Clone Remote Repo to a Local Repo
syntax: ```git clone RepoLink```\
ex: ```git clone https://github.com/example/Git_Course.git```

## Add And Reset And Commit & Explain Progress
### git status
syntax: ```git status```<br/>
ouput example:
```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Stages.png
        css/
        index.html.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
This mean there are two files name css and index.html that our remote repo doesn't know anything about it,\
you must add them to staging area then commit then push them to remote area\

Working Directory & Staging Area & Local Repo are all part of Local Repo.\
Working Directory -```git add```> Staging Area -```git commit```> Local Repo -```git push```> Remote Repo\
Remote Repo -```git fetch```> Local Repo\
Local Repo -```git checkout```> Working Directory\
Local Repo -```git merge```> Working Directory

### git add
syntax: ```git add FilePath or *```\
ex1: ```git add css```\
ex2: ```git add css index.html```\
ex3: ```git add *```\

output example:
```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   Stages.png
        new file:   css/main.css.txt
        new file:   index.html.txt
```
